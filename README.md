Welcome to my Deep Learning Final Project for Algorithm Bootcamp. The objective of this project is to succesfully train a Convolutional Neural Network for this CoronaHack Chest X-ray Dataset to make it easier and faster for healthcare workers, like doctors, to diagnose the chest x-rays of various people, whether they have a pneumonia-like disease or are completely healthy.

The dataset consists of chest x-rays of normal/healthy lungs and lungs infected by a pneumonia-like disease.

My final model got an average recall score of ... and an AUC score of ....
